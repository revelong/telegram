üìå These are the cards we currently have available. They are sold for 20% of the available balance.
üìå They do not have an AI fraud detection system, therefore can only get burnt manually, and they go through payment gateways such as Cash App, Paypal, Remitly, Western Union, etc.
üìå The main issue with these cards is not so much the card getting suspended, but them going through the payment gateway. As many payment gateways reject transactions due to fraud, it is recommended to use the cards on accounts that are old and have a history.
üìå Just as with any other card, they do run the risk of being suspended nonetheless. The only ways of suspension are the fraud department which goes through each individual card and suspends it, or the card holder recognizing their card is being used and calling in to suspend it.
üìå The best hours to cash out these cards are outside business days Monday - Friday, and if you are cashing out the cards during such hours, then attempt to avoid using the cards between 8am - 5pm PST as the fraud department may suspend the card - very unlikely.
üìå You can check these cards through the menu, but they will not burn or suspend the cards as with common checkers, reason being this is internal programming and the balance checking is automated, no third parties involved.
üìå As these cards to pertain to real people, the balance can change, therefore the server will update the most recent balance every 10 minutes.
üìå We receive only Bitcoin as form of payment.
üìå These are visa prepaid debit cards and the bin for all of these cards is 407535.
üìå The card does have an external transfer fee of $1.00, this is when you want to add funds to a third party platform such as Cashapp or Paypal. Take that into consideration when cashing out.
üìå There is a 20 daily transaction limit and $2,000 transaction limit with platforms such as Paypal or Cashapp.

INSTRUCTIONS
1. Click on the card you would like to purchase.
2. Send the amount of bitcoin stated below to the address below.
3. Bot will provide you the card upon payment.
